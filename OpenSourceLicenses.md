This file lists the module dependencies for the project and their licenses.

1. None of this module code is redistributed, either in source or binary form.
Instead, it is downloaded automatically using package managers and linked from
the code. The module download includes the license and appropriate credit.

1. So our primary check here is for modules which do not have a license, or
which are GPL licensed.
